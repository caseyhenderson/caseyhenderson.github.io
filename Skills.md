## Swift
- WhyPhone (2017): this was my first Swift application - I actually learned the language to complete this project! I learned about view controllers, UI progression and including URLs and images in my app during the development process.
- Stadiums (2020): this was my first SwiftUI app, and I was inspired to develop it after WWDC '19, although it took until lockdown for me to really make a start. This saw me learn about more complex elements, such as MapView, parsing JSONS, States and UserDefaults, and much more. It's also the focus of several blog posts, and is now available on the [App Store](https:apps.apple.com/gb/app/stadiums/id1522026145).

## C++
- Text-based game (2017) - my first experience with C++, building a basic text-based game to explore the fundamental concepts.
- Change (2019) - this project was my first major use of libraries with C++, to produce a simple GUI for this game.
- Easygraphics Game (2020) - another example of using libraries with C++, for much the same purpose only this time for a more complex game.

## Java
- Avant Watchface (2017) - a watchface developed for early Android wear devices, using Java and XML.
- Several (2020) - to be detailed further.

## C#
- Earth Rescue (2017-18) - developed in collaboration with fellow developer Cameron Leech-Thomson, this environmentally-themed infinite runner was built using C# and Unity. It ran on desktop and Android devices.

## Python
- Various projects, some with Pygame (2013-2017?) - the earliest of all, these were the projects created when I was learning to code. Some are unfortunately lost, and most are too basic to be uploaded to GitHub.
- Voluntary Tutoring (2020) - I've created a few simple projects as part of my teaching process here.
