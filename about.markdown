Hi, I'm Casey! I'm currently studying Computer Science at Sheffield Hallam University. I've been programming since I was 13, when I first learned to code using Python. My passion is in making technology more accessible, more friendly, and also more enjoyable. To that end, I've found myself using all manner of programming languages, although I always seem to come back to Swift and developing for Apple devices.

Most recently, I've been involved in C++ and Java alongside my Swift projects, and am currently in the process of completing an app using the SwiftUI framework. You can see all of my projects (or at least the ones that I remember to upload properly) on my [GitHub](https://github.com/caseyhenderson). When I'm not programming, I'm probably [writing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Casey-Henderson/e/B071RRN5WW?ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1&qid=1595950757&sr=8-1).

Feel free to get in touch - I'm on Twitter @caseyh08, and for any more formal queries (work, industrial placements, collab) send me an email at caseyhenderson13@gmail.com.
